      The goal of this project is to get data by parsing from the Wildberries 
      marketplace website and upload them to the Pandas dataframe.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The main feature of the project is that it is based on the use of the method 
      of intercepting XHR requests passing through the proxy "localhost".
    </p>
      <p align="justify">
        When parsing, methods based on the interaction of the <i>Pandas, Selenium webdriver, 
        Json, Time, Browsermobproxy</i> libraries were used.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Subsequently, the data obtained can be used in various Data Science methods. 
        If desired, the code can be easily configured to upload data 
        to any format of interest to the user, such as csv, excel, json, etc.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        As an example, the data obtained within the framework of the project is taken. 
        The screenshot shows the result for a limited number of pages. If desired, you can get any 
        data of interest to the user that does not violate the law.
